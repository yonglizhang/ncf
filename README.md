In economic and business data, the correlation matrix is a stochastic process that
fluctuates over time and exhibits seasonality. The most widely-used approaches for
estimating and forecasting the correlation matrix (e.g., multivariate GARCH) often are
hindered by computational difficulties and require strong assumptions. In this paper
we propose a method for modeling and forecasting correlation matrices that allows
the correlation to be driven nonlinearly by common factors. Our nonlinear common
factor (NCF) method simplifies estimation and provides more flexibility than previous
factor-based methods. We illustrate its use on energy prices in Boston.
